# Welcome to my personal website! I'm Andy Chen, a Computer Science and ITWS dual major at RPI, graduating class of 2025. This website serves as a platform to showcase my projects, interests, and personal journey in the world of technology.

# What makes this website special is that it was created as a result of leading a group within RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source). The group focuses on teaching students how to code websites using ReactJS as the framework and instructing them on deploying their sites via GitHub Pages.

# You'll find a portfolio of my projects on this site, ranging from individual endeavors to collaborative works. It also highlights my interests, such as playing club quadball at RPI, working out, playing video games, watching TV, and cooking.

# Feel free to explore my work and get to know me better. If you have any questions or wish to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out.
